# Critical Contracts

Cross-cutting contracts that must not break. Subsystem behavior is contracted in `docs/SPECS/`; these are the code-level invariants that span subsystems.

Part of the [architecture reference](../architecture.md).

### RuntimeManager Interface (`internal/core/llm/manager.go`)

The `RuntimeManager` interface is implemented by `LLMRuntimeManager` (production) and `MockManager` (tests). Any method added to the interface MUST be added to both implementations.

### ToolProvider Interface (`internal/core/assistant/ports.go`)

Defines how tools are listed and provided to the agent; the agent owns the interface and `internal/core/toolregistry` holds the implementations. Implemented by `LocalToolRegistry`, `MCPNodeHerder`, and `MultiToolProvider`.

### Guardrail Decision Flow (`internal/core/assistant/agent.go`)

When a tool call is blocked:

1. `GuardrailDecisionCallback` is invoked with a decision ID
2. Callback blocks on a channel (per-model `guardrail_approval_timeout_seconds`, default 5 min)
3. Frontend resolves via `POST /admin/api/conversation/guardrail-decision`
4. If `persist: true`, override saved to workspace config

### Model Persistence (Two-Tier)

- Base model info → `registry.json` (handled by `PersistModel`/`PersistReplaceModel`/`PersistDeleteModel`)
- Agent tuning overrides → `settings.yml` under `model_overrides:` (handled by `UpdateSettings`)
- Both are written simultaneously in `handleAddModel` / `handleUpdateModel`
